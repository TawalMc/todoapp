### Todo App
A todo app to store and manage todo tasks.

### Sign Up/In pages
The main task of this project is to connect frontend based on React to backend made with nodeJS. And the frist step is to learn how authentication (registration, login, password reset, access denied, password storage, storage of users data...) work. So, at each step I build a part of UI and try to connect it to backend.

### MERN stack template project
mern-stact-template is a template based on MERN stack and already come with preconfigured files. It will avoid not only the amount time spend to configured the frontend (React) and the backend (NodeJs/Express) but also the difficult occurs when try to connect the both. So we have an easy and simple api call from the frontend to the backend which confirm this connection. It used:

1. create-react-app to generate the react project
2. nodejs and express for the server
